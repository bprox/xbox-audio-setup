# Xbox Audio Setup

Welcome! I created this page as a reference for my future self (and others) who are trying to get the most out of their gaming audio for Xbox.

**This page is for those believe good game audio is an important factor in the following:**

* Pin-pointing enemy location
* Knowing if bad guys are creeping up
* Giving your team a *fair* advantage over others
* Providing an immersive experience

**If you don't believe this, the good news is you can stop reading and go back to playing Minecraft :)**

## Problem

High-end audio equipment aside for a moment, this is a typical scenario many find themselves in (myself included):

I have a decent gaming headset ([Turtle Beach Elite Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Performance-Gaming-Headset-Nintendo-Console/dp/B07XBV6FVG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2GSK6N5EOO9Y&dchild=1&keywords=turtle+beach+elite+pro&qid=1625004855&sprefix=turtle+beach+elite%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-1)) plugged directly into the controller.
After playing many games in an Xbox party with friends, there were instances where I couldn't hear the game at certain points when chatter was particularly loud.

> Boy, it sure would be nice if I could modify chat volume mix, master volume, and mute *on the fly from the controller*

This is when I bought the good ol' [Turtle Beach Headset Audio Controller Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Beach-Headset-Controller-Superhuman-Hearing/dp/B00PWRYKDE/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2A1QPNXD1DBI6&dchild=1&keywords=turtle+beach+controller+adapter&qid=1625003901&sprefix=turtle+beach+controller+%2Caps%2C165&sr=8-2)

Fantastic! Now I should be all set and ready to game with my new audio setup. Using the headset audio controller, I can now get more volume, mix chat, mute, and even boost the mids/treble using the `Superhuman Hearing` button to hear more subtle enemy movement (even if it sounds like shit!).
