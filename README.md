# Xbox Audio Setup

Welcome! I created this page as a reference for my future self (and others) who are trying to get the most out of their gaming audio for Xbox.

**This page is for those who believe good game audio is an important factor in the following:**

* Pin-pointing enemy location
* Hearing nearby enemies before they attack

* Giving your team a *fair* advantage over others
* Providing an immersive experience

**If you don't believe this, the good news is you can stop reading and go back to playing Minecraft :)**

## Problem

This is a typical scenario many find themselves in (myself included):

I have a decent gaming headset ([Turtle Beach Elite Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Performance-Gaming-Headset-Nintendo-Console/dp/B07XBV6FVG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2GSK6N5EOO9Y&dchild=1&keywords=turtle+beach+elite+pro&qid=1625004855&sprefix=turtle+beach+elite%2Caps%2C188&sr=8-1)) plugged directly into the controller.
After playing many games in an Xbox party with friends, there were instances where I couldn't hear the game at certain points when chatter was particularly loud.

> Boy, it sure would be nice if I could modify chat volume mix, master volume, and mute *on the fly from the controller*.

This is when I bought the good ol' [Turtle Beach Headset Audio Controller Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Beach-Headset-Controller-Superhuman-Hearing/dp/B00PWRYKDE/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2A1QPNXD1DBI6&dchild=1&keywords=turtle+beach+controller+adapter&qid=1625003901&sprefix=turtle+beach+controller+%2Caps%2C165&sr=8-2)

Fantastic! Now I should be all set and ready to game with my new audio setup. Using the headset audio controller, I can now get more volume, mix chat, mute, and even boost the mids/treble using the `Superhuman Hearing` button to hear more subtle enemy movement -- even if it sounds like shit!

This got me through a couple years of gaming with only minor complaints with this setup.

## ... and then he said... "It's still not good enough!"

I ~~wanted~~ needed more from my audio. I upgraded to a faster Xbox and a real gaming monitor, so now it was time to upgrade my audio setup.

At this point, I mostly just wanted more volume so I could crank it when I really needed to hear, like in those intense 1v1 situations.



Around the same time I was itching for better audio, I started a new job and treated myself to some higher-end headphones (Sennheiser HD6XXs).

They are high impedance, open-back headphones. This basically means you need extra power to drive them properly (more on this later).

They were so light and comfy that I wanted to use them for gaming -- but going down this path would undoubtedly complicate my setup.

## Xbox Limitations

Before we dig into the details, I need to get some things out of the way. Microsoft is known for being very picky about what they let into the family.

It is no different when it comes to the Xbox division. Any officially **licensed** Xbox One accessory that connects to your console wired or wirelessly via USB works on Xbox One.

Currently, the only USB-connected gaming DAC/Amp in this category is the [Astro Gaming's MixAmp Pro TR ($130)](https://www.amazon.com/ASTRO-Gaming-MixAmp-Dolby-Audio-Xbox/dp/B07NSNDHK2/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=astro+mixamp&qid=1625105116&sr=8-4)

There are a ton of other gaming DAC/Amps on the market but they are sadly not supported on Xbox.

So you have 3 options for getting your audio:

1) The MixAmp Pro TR
2) 3.5mm via controller
3) Optical out (Not available on Series X/S)

*Note: I have not fully tested how party chat works using the optical out method. It theoretically should work if there are settings to send ALL audio (game/party) through the same output -- this is not the default.*

## So you want better game audio?

### Do you have a regular gaming headset (easy to drive) and don't want to spend more than $130?

\* _visible discomfort_ \* Go ahead and get the MixAmp and call it a day.

I have my own opinions on why I would not purchase the MixAmp for myself. But, if you fall into this category, it will probably be a big enough upgrade that you will be happy.

### Do you have high impedance headphones (need lots of power output) and have a flexible budget?

Congratulations! We're in the same boat and I see land ahead :)

Since I'm not using the MixAmp to handle all audio output AND mic input, I have some problems to address:

1) How will I get game AND chat audio to my headphones?
2) How will I connect a mic to party chat?
3) How does it all fit together?

Aside from that, I also need the right equipment to drive my headphones for non-gaming listening.

## My Setup

I am running the Xbox One X, which has optical out for audio (foreshadowing).

After some research, I came across a YouTube comment that mentioned there is an Xbox app for PC.

\* *lightbulb* \*

I can use the Xbox app to connect to party chat and get all my game audio from the optical out!

I installed the Xbox app on my PC and used my existing audio interface / microphone as input to voice chat. This worked flawlessly.

Next, I need to get the game audio using the optical out from the Xbox. Remember though, I needed to purchase a new DAC and Amp in order to power my new headphones anyway. But, now I'm adding a new requirement: the DAC must have optical **IN** so I can also use this equipment for better gaming audio.

### A stack of Schitt

I ordered the Schiit Magni (headphone amp) and Modi (DAC) to fit my needs.

After hooking it all up I realized I overlooked 1 crucial detail.

**You can only use 1 channel at a time on the DAC. Either Optical IN (Xbox game audio) or USB IN (Party chat audio from PC) -- not both.**

*facepalm*

I need to join these 2 channels somehow so that both are fed into my headphone amp simultaneously. Both game audio (xbox) and party chat (PC) need to be feed into a DAC of some kind and the combined output can then be fed into the headphone amp. The solution was simple -- just get another DAC and some RCA splitter cables to join the output from DAC1 (Xbox game audio) and DAC2 (PC party chat audio) as input into my headphone amp. You don't need to buy a fancy DAC for this. I loved the Schitt Modi already and saw future uses for it, so I just decided to get another one!

Now, I have a Schitt stack consisting of the following:

| Position | Name | Description |
| :--- |:---- |:--- |
| Top | [Magni Heresy](https://www.schiit.com/products/magni-1) | Headphone Amp |
| Middle | [Modi 3+](https://www.schiit.com/products/modi-1) | DAC for PC USB audio (party chat) |
| Bottom | [Modi 3+](https://www.schiit.com/products/modi-1) | DAC for Xbox optical out audio (game audio) |

Using a single knob on the Magni, I am able to increase volume to uncomfortable amounts (Don't do this obviously).
I can mix party chat directly from my PC (Keyboard shortcuts work great here)



## other options

HDMI optical extractor (HDMI to HDMI pass-through, with an optical output for extracted 2-channel audio)
(BUT... big but right now... HDMI 2.1 speeds aren't supported by the current offerings)
Connect Series X via HDMI to a TV which has an optical output for audio (this works currently)
